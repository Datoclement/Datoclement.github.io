The only differences between those which we call *gene*s and those which we call *virus* are that the methods of transmission to the future of what we call gene are through sperms or eggs, and therefore they have interest in common to preserve the body which they share... that minority which are not, are by sneezing into the air, or..., or..., we call them virus. -- Dawkins
