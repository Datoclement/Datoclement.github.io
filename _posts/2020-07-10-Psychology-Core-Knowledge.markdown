*Core Knowledge identifies four broad categories of innate assumptions that form the foundations of human cognition, and which are largely shared by our non-human relatives: objectness and elementary physics, agentness and goal-directedness, natural numbers and elementary arithmetic, and finally elementary geometry and topology.* -- On the Measure of Intelligence.



*Ingredients* to make a machine to think in a human way:

1. Prior sets. (Intuitive physics and intuitive psychology)
2. Learning. (Causal models, compositionality and learning-to-learn)



Intuitive psychology may be counted as intuitive physics or its complement.
